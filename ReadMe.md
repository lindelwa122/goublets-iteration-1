# Goublets

A Goublet is a tiny, simple creature that lives in its world called
Glorzo. Goublets just move around in a safe Glorzo, minding their
own business. Goublets live forever, and each day they move to one of
the eight positions around them if it is not already occupied.

## Exercise

Implement the interfaces for the `Position` class and `Goublet` class. Ensure
that all tests pass â€” and go crazy!
